  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  1. Dining_Philosopher_Semaphores.c = In this program, we are solving the basic 'Dining Philosopher problem' using the semaphores and by threads.
  
  2. Dining_Philosopher_Semaphores_2.c = In this program, we are solving the basic 'Dining Philosopher problem' without using the Synchronization primitives and by strict ordering the resources. 
  
  1. Dining_Philosopher_Semaphores.c = In this program, we are solving the modified 'Dining Philosopher problem' using the semaphores and by threads. In which there are two additional souce bowl which can be accessed by any of the philosopher at any given time.
