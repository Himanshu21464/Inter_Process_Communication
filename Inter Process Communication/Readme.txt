THERE ARE TOTAL 6 FILES FOR THIS PART:-

  1. P1_FIFO.c
  2. P2_FIFO.c
  3. P1_Socket.c
  4. P2_Socket.c
  5. P1_Shared_Memory.c
  6. P2_Shared_Memory.c
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
THERE ARE THREE PARTS IN TOTAL:-

  1. BY USING FIFO:-  In this program, P1 creates an array of 50 strings by random generation method and then it send 5 strings one by by to P2.
                       After recieving 5 strings from P1, P2 send back the Maximum ID of the recieved strings for P1 to acknowledge that IPC is working correctly and can proceed further.
                       
 
  2. BY USING UNIX SOCKET:-  In this program, P1 creates an array of 50 strings by random generation method and then it send 5 strings one by by to P2.
                       After recieving 5 strings from P1, P2 send back the Maximum ID of the recieved strings for P1 to acknowledge that IPC is working correctly and can proceed further.
  
  3. BY USING SHARED_MEMORY:-  In this program, P1 creates an array of 50 strings by random generation method and then it send 5 strings one by by to P2.
                       After recieving 5 strings from P1, P2 send back the Maximum ID of the recieved strings for P1 to acknowledge that IPC is working correctly and can proceed further.
